MTN Telecom offers mobile and internet services to its customers. These services
include phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection,
tech support, and streaming TV and movies. The management would like to get your
assistance in understanding the subscribed customers. Your recommendations informed
by your analysis will help them make decisions on effective customer retention
programs.
We have provided you with the current customer data. Since you will be working towards
a descriptive report rather than a predictive one, you decide to think critically about the
kind of questions that would help you craft customer retention programs. You then later
use the given data set to answer your questions, but before you start, you reading,
explore, clean, and analyze your dataset.

The provided customer data set includes information about:
● Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn.
● The services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines,
internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and
streaming TV and movies.
● Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract,
payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges.
● The demographic information about customers – gender, age range, and if they
have partners and dependents.
Each row represents a customer, and each column contains the customer’s attributes
described on the column Metadata.
